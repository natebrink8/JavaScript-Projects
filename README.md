1. Pizza Menu
2. Tic Tac Toe Game
3. Calculator


One.  Pizza Menu
    The pizza menu assignment allowed for learning around styling and functionality for the selection of various options for an "order" which both drove a Total for a customer as well as maintained console logs in the browser, for the developer.

Two.  Tic Tac Toe Game
    This assignment was a lot of fun, both in building the original as well as customizing with our own X and O images and the noises within the game.

Three.  Calculator
    The program we built for this assignment allowed for some expanded JavaScript use to arrive at various calculations in the program. A very fun exercise!
